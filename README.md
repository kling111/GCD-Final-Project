### Project Summary

These are the main steps run_analysis take throughout its code. 
1. Combines the training and test sets to create one large data set.
2. Subsets the measurements of the mean and standard deviation. 
3. Uses appropriate names to reflect the activities in the data set
4. Creates a second data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
